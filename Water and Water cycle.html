		<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"><font size="+2">For example, lower water levels can contribute to higher concentrations of natural and human pollutants. 
		Less water going down the drain means more water available in the lakes, rivers and streams that we use for recreation and wildlife uses to survive.<p></font>
		
		<p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"><font size="+2">Water for the environment supports the health of the river so that it can in turn provide for human needs. As water moves onto the floodplain, 
		it releases carbon that energises the food web. River pulses trigger fish breeding and movement.</p></font>

	<h1 align="center"><em><u>WATER CYCLE</h1></em></u>
	<h2> The water cycle describes how water helps in cooling down the Earth. It also shows the
	continuous movement and cycle of water between the Earth and its atmosphere.
	The water cycle has 7 stages </h2>
	<h2 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">
		<ul>
			<li> Evaporation</li>
			<li> Condensation</li>
			<li> Precipitation</li>
			<li> Sublimation</li>
			<li> Transpiration</li>
			<li> Runoff</li>
			<li> Infiltration</li>
		</ul>
	</h2>
	<h2>These stages can be seen through our everyday life like how evaporation can be seen while we
	boil water and how Precipitation is seen as rain.
	The main stages of the water cycle are Evaporation, Condensation, and lastly Precipitation.</h2>
	
	<h2><b><u>IMPORTANCE AND PURPOSE OF THE WATER CYCLE:</h1><b></u>
	<h2>The water cycle is important for it regulates the weather patterns here on Earth. It is also to
	spread the source of water so it can be available to animals, humans, insects, and more living
	organisms.</h2>
	<h2>It is a provider, supporter, and maintainer to the richness of our land.
	It spreads resources such as water to give and support life here on Earth. It is a cycle that
	continues for generations. This is why it is important to take care of our home planet. If we
	ignore taking care of our home, the water cycle will be one of the things in our environment that
	will be affected by any harm we do. </h2>
	
	<h2><b><u>THE 7 STAGES OF WATER CYCLE:</h1></b></u>

		<h2><b>Evaporation</b></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Evaporation is the process wherein a liquid turns into a gaseous state.</li>
			<li>Water turns into the state og gas whenever the sun heats up any source of water.</li>
		</ul>
	<b><u>Purpose:</b></u>
	This stage is use by experts to separate the solute (solid) from the solvent(liquid).
	<b><u>Example: </b></u>
	<p>Boiling water, Drying clothes in the sun, Drying wet hair, etc…</p>
	
		<h2><b>Condensation</b></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Condensation is the process where water vapor becomes liquid.</li>
			<li>This is the reverse action of evaporation.</li>
			<li>The water vapor will likely turn into cloud or a gas that is full of moisture.</li>
			<li>(Dew is simply condensed water in the atmosphere.)
			<li>Air temperatures can reach or fall below the dew point naturally.</li>
			<li>That is why ground, structures, and objects outside are usually coated with water droplets in the morning.</li>
		</ul>
	<b><u>Purpose:</b></u>
	<ul>
		<li>Condensation is responsible for making clouds. 
		Without this stage, The liquid (i.e water) will remain in its gas state.</li>
	<b><u>Example:</b></u>
		<p>Fog, Clouds, and more…</p>
	
		<h2><b>Precipitation</b></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Precipitation is a stage of the water cycle where a liquid or frozen water falls down to the Earth.</li>
			<li>When water vapor condenses into bigger and bigger droplets of water.</li>
			<li>When the drops are heavy enough, they fall to the earth.</li>
		</ul>
	<b><u>Purpose:</b></u>
	<ul>
		<li>Precipitation cleans the atmosphere and wash out the air pollution and natural aerosols.</li>
		<li>But mainly, it is to spread water supply to animals and humans.</li>
	</ul>
	<b><u>Example:</b></u>
		<p>Rain, hail, snow, and etc…</p>

		<h2><b>Sublimation</b></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Sublimation is where moisture enters the atmosphere directly from ice to snow.</li>
			<li>Sublimation is a process where ice or snow directly turns into a gaseous state.</li>
		</ul>
	<b><u>Example:</b></u>
		<p>dry ice and solid fresheners</p>

		<h2><b>Transpiration</b></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Transpiration is the biological process by which water is lost in the form of water vapor from the aerial parts of the plants.</li>
		</ul>
	<b><u>Example:<b></u>
		<p>stomatal transpiration, cuticular transpiration, and lenticular transpiration</p>
		
		<h2><b>Runoff</b></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Runoff is when the precipitation is not soaked by the lands of the Earth but instantly moves into a nearby water source like streams or lakes.</li>
		</ul>
	<b><u>Purpose:</b></u>
		It is to prevent moisture to build up and infiltration.
	<b><u>Example:</b></u>
		snowmelts
		<h2><b>Infiltration</b></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Infiltration is a process where the water that came from the Precipitation stage falls down and is absorbed into the ground.</li>
	<b><u>Example:</b></u>
		<p>pouring water into a sponge</p>
